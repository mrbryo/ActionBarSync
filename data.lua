--[[ Big Blizzard Bear - Mount
    Could be just a fluke from an old action bar placement? This is the data the addon captured:
    
    ["41"] = {
        unknownActionType = true,
        blizData = {},
        actionID = 41,
        subType = "MOUNT",
        originalSourceID = 58983,
        name = "Unknown",
        barPosn = 5,
        sourceID = -1,
        actionType = "companion",
        icon = -1,
        btnName = "MultiBarLeftButton5"
    },

    If I re-add the bear then same error about "companion" didn't show up.
